Are you talking at a resonable volume? Well stop it. You're raging. Enjoy some relaxing nature sounds.


# What does this actually do?
Basically if you talk at a certain volume then it'll ask if you're ok. If you're not ok it will open some relaxing nature sounds in firefox. I kinda ran out of time cause I had to scrap my last project and I couldn't think of other stuff to add.
